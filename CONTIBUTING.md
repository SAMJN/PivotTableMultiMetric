## Pull Requests

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to this project are very welcome! They are most likely to be merged in if they conform to this project's basic goals, scope and structure:

* If accepted, you agree that your pull-requests will be released to the world under the same license as the rest of the code: the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
* It's probably best to [log an issue](https://github.com/SAMJN/PivotTableMultiMetric/issues/new) to report a bug or ask how something was meant to be done before jumping in and modifying the code, if only to confirm that there isn't another way to do what you're aiming for, and to increase the odds that your pull request will be merged :)
* Multiple small pull requests which aim to solve clearly-stated problems are preferable to large pull requests which make many unrelated changes
