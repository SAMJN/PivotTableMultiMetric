# PivotTable.js

PivotTable.js is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI and originally written in CoffeeScript by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com).

It is available under an MIT license from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) under the name `pivottable`. And on [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/nicolaskruchten/pivottable), it is `nicolaskruchten/pivottable`.

PivotTable.js can be used with [Python/Jupyter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pivottablejs) and [R/RStudio](https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable) and you can [try it right now](https://pivottable.js.org/examples/local.html) in your browser on a CSV file.

**Are you using React? Check out the React port: [react-pivottable](https://github.com/plotly/react-pivottable).**

# How do I use the UI?

PivotTable.js implements a pivot table drag'n'drop UI similar to that found in popular spreadsheet programs. You can drag attributes into/out of the row/column areas, and specify rendering, aggregation and filtering options. There is a [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/UI-Tutorial) in the wiki.

After installing the original file, replace pivot.js [of Nicolas Kruchten](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/dist/pivot.js) with the new pivot.js [of SAMJN](https://github.com/SAMJN/PivotTableMultiMetric/blob/master/dist/pivot.js)
